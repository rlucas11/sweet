Replication of Meier, B. P, Moeller, S. K., Riemer-Peltz, M., & Robinson, M. D. (2012). Sweet taste Preferences and experiences predict prosocial inferences, personalities, and behaviors. _Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 102,_ 163-174.

In this study, we attempted a large-sample exact replication of Study 2 of Meier et al. (2012). In the original study, 55 participants (27 Male) reported on their personality using Goldberg's (1999) 50-item IPIP measure. In addition, participants reported their liking for a variety of foods classified as being bitter, salty, sour, spicy, or sweet. They found that Agreeableness correlated .36 with liking of sweet-tasting food. 

We administered the same personality and taste-preference measures to 414 participants (122 Male). We replicated the direction of the effect from their study, with a correlation of .22, 95% CI [.12 to .31]. Our correlation was, however, significantly smaller than the .36 value obtained in the original study. 

A standard procedure in our lab is to use directed questions (asking participants to select a specific response option for one or more questions) as a quality check. Of the initial 414 participants, 85 failed the quality check (this number is consistent with similar studies using participant-pool samples). If only those participants who passed the quality check are included, the correlation is .21, 95% CI [.10, .32]. Again, consistent with the original study, this correlation is significantly greater than zero, though significantly weaker than that found in the original study. 

We were also concerned whether the effect held controlling for gender. Indeed, gender (scored '1' for Female and '2' for Male) was significantly associated both with Agreeableness ( _r_ = -.20) and preference for sweet tastes ( _r_ = -.11). However, the association between Agreeableness and liking of sweet tastes was still significantly greater than zero, even after controlling for gender (partial _r_ = .20).
